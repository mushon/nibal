# Dual Layer Demo: Map + Overlays

Test the dual-iframe system with actual map and composition content.


## Start with Map

[](map/#31.52888,34.47937,18.14,15.0,0/+jabalia "Start with Jabalia view")

Map loads in background layer (z-index: 1)


## Animated Path

[](map/#31.52090,34.47332,14.00,19.2,48.5/+jabalia-rafah:follow "Distance ticker animation")

The ~37km path animates with distance ticker in the background.


## Another Map View

[](map/#31.43672,34.34664,10.16,37.6,0.0/+jabalia-rafah,+jabalia,+rafah "Full path with markers")

Shows the complete displacement path with start/end markers.
