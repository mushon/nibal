## Life Before

My name is Nibal al-Hisi. I’m 25. When the war began in October 2023, I was living in my hometown of Jabalya with my husband Ahmad and our baby daughter Rita.


{.testimony typewriter}
[](svg/#intro-pre.svg/-0.67,0.25,2.4/,+nibal2023)

I’m the youngest of nine brothers and three sisters.

After high-school, I started studying English and Translation at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City.

In my final year, I met Ahmad. I felt we were alike, that he understood me.

I married him despite my parents’ objections. I knew we wouldn’t live in luxury, but I felt he was my treasure.

In September 2022, we moved into our own apartment in his family’s building in Jabalya, not far from my parents. 


{.testimony typewriter}
We had a happy life, surrounded by the love and warmth of our families.

I was in shock. I still felt like they were still there, or would grow back one day. 


{.testimony typewriter}
I asked about Rita, and they told me she was safe and sound. That’s what kept me going. 
That and having Ahmad with me.

After 40 days, Nibal was discharged from the hospital. She, Ahmad and Rita had to flee again. 

They reached the “humanitarian zone” in al-Mawasi and again stayed in a tent.

From the start of the offensive, Israel designated an area near the town of al-Mawasi a “humanitarian zone.”

Within months, the “humanitarian zone” became overcrowded with tents housing more than one million IDPs from all over Gaza.

In November 2024, when Nibal and her family arrived, many people in the camp there described extreme crowding, with an acute shortage of food and water and no shelter from the cold and the heavy rain.

Nibal had to begin her recovery in inhuman conditions. 

Tens of thousands of IDPs with injuries, disabilities and amputated limbs, many following Israeli attacks, are still struggling to survive in tents.

I dreamed of returning north to my family, to the days when we were all together. I missed them terribly, and longed for a ceasefire so I could go back to them and feel safe again.

But I was losing hope.

After about two months in the tent in al-Mawasi, Nibal learned in January 2025 along with the rest of Gaza residents that a second ceasefire between Israel and Hamas had taken effect. 


{.meta}
In the weeks that followed, about half a million displaced people began returning to their homes in northern Gaza.

Nibal and Ahmad walked north with Rita, now almost one and a half years old. 

Nibal’s relatives met them at the Netzarim checkpoint, dropped Ahmad off at the couple’s apartment and took Nibal to her parents’ home with Rita.

My family welcomed me with hugs, songs and tears. Every night, my brothers and sisters gathered at my parents’ house.

[](svg/#ceasefire_hope.svg/-0.39,-0.4,1.93/+nibal_rita_home.jpg,+nibal_rita_happy.jpg,@vimeo-1129854927)

They changed her diapers, held her, played with her. Thanks to them, I felt my life was slowly getting back on track.

After about a month of recovery at her parents’, Ahmad asked Nibal to come home.

Despite her parents’ concerns, she went back to their apartment with Rita, and they hired someone to help her.

But then the war resumed. 

Under the pressure of bombardments and blockade, tensions in the marriage resurfaced. 


{.meta}
Ahmad was struggling with the repercussions of his time in Israeli detention. 


{.testimony typewriter}
After he was released and came back from Israel, he seemed troubled and anxious. Something in him had changed. 
In some ways, I felt like he had lost a part of himself there.

{.testimony typewriter}
At first he was very supportive. But over time, I felt he was only taking care of me out of pity.

Through everything, I tried to focus on Rita. She was the most important thing in my life. I did everything I could to overcome the tension with Ahmad and care for her.

In April 2025, Israel bombed the home of Nibal’s sister ‘Alaa in Jabalya, killing all three of her children: Wasim, 10, Muhannad, 8, and Khawlah, 5. 


{.meta}
Nibal received the devastating news while tensions between her and Ahmad were at their peak. 


{.testimony typewriter}
I felt he couldn’t take care of Rita and me anymore. The strain of looking after us and getting us food and water made him irritable, and sometimes I was even afraid of him. 

At some point, he demanded that I go back to my parents.

In early June 2025, several months after returning to their apartment, Nibal decided to move back to her parents with Rita.

I was frustrated because I couldn’t do anything on my own, and I struggled to care for Rita.

We heard a huge explosion and screams outside. People were running. They told us the Israeli army had ordered everyone to evacuate the area within 15 minutes. 

We ran outside terrified, almost empty-handed. I left behind our documents, our clothes, everything. But we managed to escape in time.

Nibal walked with Rita and about 50 relatives – her parents, her siblings and their spouses and children – from Jabalya to Gaza City, searching for safety.
