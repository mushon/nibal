It has killed tens of thousands of people, injured hundreds of thousands more, destroyed homes and infrastructure and starved most of the population – all as part of a systematic, coordinated attack aimed at annihilating all facets of life in Gaza.

Over the course of two years, Israel repeatedly ordered Gaza’s residents to uproot themselves. Approximately 1.9 million people, about 90% of Gaza’s population, were displaced at least once since October 2023, often after losing family members and most of their belongings.

Every part of my life is now filled with suffering.  The heat in the tent is unbearable. I sweat but can’t shower alone. I suffer from insect bites because I can’t even scratch myself. 
I look around and see my brothers’ wives caring for their families, and I’m ashamed to ask them for help.

### Oct 25

Nibal’s story is just one of 2 million stories in Gaza – stories of people suffering loss, hunger and ongoing displacement, forced by Israel to live in unbearable conditions, abandoned by the international community and left with no real hope for a better future.

In recent months, Nibal has shared her story on social and mainstream media. She hopes it will help raise money to get prosthetic limb surgery outside Gaza, so she can regain some of her independence.
