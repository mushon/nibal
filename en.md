My name is Nibal al-Hisi. I’m 25. When the war began in October 2023, I was living in my hometown of Jabalya with my husband Ahmad and our baby daughter Rita.


{.testimony typewriter}

After high-school, I started studying English and Translation at Al-Azhar University in Gaza City.

In my final year, I met Ahmad. I felt we were alike, that he understood me.

I married him despite my parents’ objections. I knew we wouldn’t live in luxury, but I felt he was my treasure.

In September 2022, we moved into our own apartment in his family’s building in Jabalya, not far from my parents.

After 40 days, Nibal was discharged from the hospital. She, Ahmad and Rita had to flee again. 

They reached the “humanitarian zone” in al-Mawasi and again stayed in a tent.

Nibal and Ahmad walked north with Rita, now almost one and a half years old.

באפריל 2025 הפציץ הצבא הישראלי את ביתה של אחותה של ניבאל בג׳אבליא. כתוצאה מההפצצה נהרגו שלושת ילדיה של אלאא, אחותה: וסים, בן 10, מוהנד, בן 8, וח'וולה, בת 5.
