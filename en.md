Since October 2023, Israel has been conducting an assault on the Gaza Strip aimed at destroying all aspects of life: killing of tens of thousands of people, injuring hundreds of thousands, destroying buildings and infrastructure on an unprecedented scale, and starving most of the population.

In these two years, Israel has repeatedly ordered the residents of Gaza to uproot. Some 1.9 million people, about 90% of the population, have been displaced at least once since October 2023, often after losing family and most of their belongings.

Living in the storage room was a bit more stable than in the tent, but I felt torn. I was grateful to be with my husband and daughter, but really missed my family up north. I felt lonely and alienated, far from home.
